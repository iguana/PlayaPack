## DIY Portable battery, solar generator, and more! 

### Why would I want to make a portable battery? can't I just buy one?

yes, you can just buy one, but:
- making one is more fun
- you can get way more features for a lot less money
- you can customize it to meet your specific needs
- have I mentioned that it's fun?

### OK, what do I need?

you need:
- LiFePO4 cells
- a battery management system (BMS)
- a case to store everything in
- ports for charging and discharging
- power converters to go from system voltage to useful voltage, like USB (QC 3.0, 2.1 Amp, USB-C, etc)
- solar charge converter - if charging from solar panels
- inverter - if you want 120v or 220V plugs
- fuses, wiring, connectors, switches, etc

## OK, how do I decide which kind of everything to get?

The first step is to decide what features you will want. What is your main use case? How much power do you need to output at once? How much energy do you need to store?

Typical LFP cells have a charge rate of 1/2 C (1/2 of their Ah capacity in Amps), and a discharge rate of 1C.

Then, you will need to pick what your system voltage will be. For most use cases, 12 volt systems are ideal.
